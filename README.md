# boids3d

This project is the 3D version of the [boids2d](https://github.com/yeranosyanvahan/boid2d) project, designed to simulate the behavior of bird-like entities, known as "boids", in a three-dimensional environment. The `boids3d` simulation extends the principles of the `boids2d` model, incorporating additional spatial dynamics and realistic 3D atmospheric effects.

Here is how the project would look like.

## Introduction
`boids3d` offers an immersive and interactive experience by simulating the flight patterns and group behaviors of boids in a three-dimensional space. This project aims to demonstrate the complex dynamics of flocking behavior while allowing for exploration of individual boid interactions in a more comprehensive environment.

## Forces in 3D

The forces are the same as in the 2D, but there are roll and yaw axises that have been implemented.

## Atmosphere
The atmosphere is the same as described in the boids2d project.
